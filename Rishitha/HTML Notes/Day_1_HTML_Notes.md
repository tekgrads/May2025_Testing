# üåê Web Technologies Day 1 Notes ‚Äì HTML, CSS & JavaScript

## 1. What is HTML?
**HTML (HyperText Markup Language)** is the standard language used to create and structure web pages. It defines the layout using elements like headings, paragraphs, links, images, tables, etc.

- HTML gives structure to the content.
- It is a markup language, not a programming language.
- Common file extension: `.html`

## 2. What is CSS?
**CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)** is used to style and design HTML elements. It defines the look and feel of a web page such as layout, colors, fonts, spacing, and alignment.

- CSS separates design from content.
- You can write CSS inside the HTML file (internal) or in a separate file (external).
- Common file extension: `.css`

## 3. What is JavaScript?
**JavaScript** is a client-side scripting language used to make a web page interactive. It helps respond to user actions such as clicking a button, submitting a form, or fetching data dynamically.

- JavaScript is a programming language.
- It is mostly used in the browser, but can also be used on the server (Node.js).
- Common file extension: `.js`

        alert("Hello from JavaScript!");
