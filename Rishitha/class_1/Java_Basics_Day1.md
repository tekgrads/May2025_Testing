# 🌟 Java Basics – Day 1 Notes

## 🔄 Compiler vs Interpreter

### 🔹 Compiler:
- A compiler is a software program that translates the **entire source code at once** into **machine code** (binary format).
- If there are any errors in the code, the compiler shows **all errors together after checking the full program**.

### 🔹 Interpreter:
- An interpreter translates and executes code **line-by-line**.
- If an error occurs on a line, it **stops there and shows the error**. The remaining code won't run until the error is fixed.

---

## ⚙️ How C & C++ Work

- In C/C++, we write programs in **source code** format (`.c`, `.cpp`).
- The **compiler translates** this source code **directly into machine code**.
- The **processor executes** the machine code, and the program runs.
- ⚠️ The machine code generated is **platform dependent**.

---

## ☕ How Java Works

- Java source code (`.java`) is compiled into an **intermediate form** called **Bytecode** (`.class`) using the **Java Compiler**.
- Bytecode is **not directly understandable** by the processor.
- The **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** acts as a layer that:
  - Reads the Bytecode
  - Converts it into **machine code** for the specific system
  - Runs the program

---

## ❓ Why C & C++ Were Lacking – What Java Solved

- C and C++ are powerful but **platform dependent**.
- Code compiled in Windows **won’t run in Linux**, and vice versa.
- Java solves this problem by introducing:
  - **Bytecode** (intermediate, same for all platforms)
  - **JVM** (converts bytecode into platform-specific machine code)
- Hence, Java is **Platform Independent**.

> 💡 Java’s philosophy: **“Write Once, Run Anywhere”**

---

## 🔸 Bytecode

- **Bytecode** is the **intermediate code** generated by the Java compiler after compiling source code.
- It is **not machine code**, but it is designed to be **understood by the JVM**.

### ✅ Key Points:
- Platform Independent
- Cannot run directly on the processor
- Needs JVM to convert it into machine code

---

## 🖥️ Platform Dependent vs Platform Independent

### 🔻 Platform Dependent:
- Definition: If a program runs **only on the same OS** where it was compiled.
- Example: **C/C++**
  - C program compiled in Windows → Works only in Windows
  - Won’t run in Linux

### 🔺 Platform Independent:
- Definition: If a program can run on **any OS**, it is platform independent.
- Example: **Java**
  - Java program compiled into Bytecode → Can run on any OS **with JVM**
  - JVM is available for Windows, Linux, Mac, etc.

## ☑️ How to Install Java

1. **Download JDK** from the [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html) (choose version based on OS).
2. **Run the installer** and complete the setup.
3. **Set the PATH Environment Variable**:
   - Copy JDK’s `bin` path:  
     Example: `C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21in`
   - Add it to system **PATH** variable.
4. **Verify installation** in Command Prompt:
   ```bash
   java --version
   javac
   ```

## 🌐 PATH Environment Variable

### 🔸 What is PATH?

- `PATH` is a **system environment variable** in your computer's OS.
- It tells the **Operating System where to look** for executable files like `java`, `javac`, etc.

### 🔹 Why Set PATH After Installing Java?

- After installing Java, the tools like `java` and `javac` are inside this folder:
  ```
  C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21in
  ```
- But the system doesn’t know where this folder is unless you **add it to the PATH**.
- Once added, you can use Java commands from **any directory** in the Command Prompt.

### ✅ Purpose of PATH Variable

| ✅ Feature                         | 💡 Description                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Tells OS where to search          | OS looks inside `PATH` folders to find tools like `java`, `javac`            |
| Run tools from any location       | You can compile and run Java code from **any folder** in CMD                 |
| Saves time and avoids errors      | Prevents errors like: `java is not recognized as an internal or external command` |

## 🧰 JDK vs JRE

| Component | Full Form                | Description                                                                 |
|-----------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JDK**   | Java Development Kit     | 🧑‍💻 Complete package to **write, compile, and run** Java programs           |
|           |                          | Includes: compiler (`javac`), debugger, JVM, and development tools          |
| **JRE**   | Java Runtime Environment | 🚀 Used **only to run** Java programs                                       |
|           |                          | Contains JVM + core libraries, but **no compiler** (can't compile code)     |

### 🔎 Summary:

- To **develop Java programs**, use **JDK**
- To **just run Java applications**, **JRE** is enough
- `JDK = JRE + Development Tools`

---

### 📌 Verify Java Installation

Open Command Prompt and type:

```bash
java --version
javac --version
```

If both show versions, your setup is successful ✅
