# Java Basics: Understanding Programming, Platforms, and Compilation

## 1. Purpose of Programming Languages
- The main purpose of any programming language is to **solve a problem**.

## 2. Interacting with Computers
- A computer contains peripherals like **keyboard, mouse, monitor, CPU**, etc.
- These are **input/output devices** that help us interact with the computer.

## 3. What is a Computer?
- A computer is essentially a **processor** that executes system tasks and software like Word, Notepad, Graphics tools, etc.

## 4. Operating Systems
- The **Operating System (OS)** is a way to interact with the processor.
- Examples: DOS Commands, Command Prompt.
- Because DOS was not user-friendly, new OSes were developed: **Windows, macOS, Linux**â€”each with unique capabilities.

## 5. Need for Programming Languages
- On Windows, we download apps or programs as per our needs (e.g., checking if a student passed or failed).
- There are two ways to achieve this:
  1. **Direct interaction** with the processor.
  2. Use **programming languages** that communicate with the processor on our behalf.
    - Analogy: Watching a foreign movie with **subtitles**.

## 6. Binary Language and Programming
- Computers understand only **binary language (0s and 1s)**.
- Humans can't communicate in binary, so we use programming languages:  
  Examples: `C`, `C++`, `Java`, `.NET`, `Python`, `Data Science`, etc.
- Older languages like COBOL, Pascal are mostly deprecated.

## 7. Why Java?
- Java has **more features** compared to `C` and `C++`.
- Java supports **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**.
- Java is **platform independent**.
- It has **Garbage Collection** and does not support **pointers**, making it safer.

> ðŸ“± *Example:* Choosing a 10k-feature phone over a 7k-feature phone â€” Java offers more.

## 8. Comparing C, C++, Java, Python
- `C`: No OOP, platform-dependent.
- `C++`: Has OOP but still platform-dependent.
- `Java`: Strong in enterprise applications, platform-independent.
- `Python`: Excellent for scripting and web apps.

## 9. What is a Platform?
- **Platform = Operating System + Processor**

## 10. Source Code and Compilation

### Compilation Flow:
