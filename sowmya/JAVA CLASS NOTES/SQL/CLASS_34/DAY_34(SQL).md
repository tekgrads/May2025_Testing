## üîó What is a Join?

A **Join** in SQL is used to combine data from two or more tables based on a related column between them.

> It helps fetch meaningful data that is spread across multiple tables.

### üîπ Types of Joins:

1. **INNER JOIN** ‚Äì Returns only the rows that have matching values in both tables.
2. **LEFT JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table. If no match, shows `NULL`.
3. **RIGHT JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows from the right table and matching rows from the left. If no match, shows `NULL`.
4. **FULL JOIN** ‚Äì Returns all rows from both tables. If there's no match, fills with `NULL`.
5. **CROSS JOIN** ‚Äì Combines every row from the first table with every row from the second (Cartesian product).

## üîç VIEWS

A **View** is a virtual table created from a `SELECT` query.
It shows data from real tables but does **not store** the data itself.

### ‚úÖ Why Use Views?

* Simplify complex queries
* Hide sensitive columns
* Reuse logic (filters, joins)
* Present data in a specific format

---

## üìä MySQL INDEXES

An **Index** in MySQL is a database object that helps **speed up data retrieval** by making searches faster.
It works like an index in a book ‚Äî helping the database find rows quickly without scanning the whole table.

### ‚úÖ Why Use Indexes?

1. Speed up `SELECT` queries
2. Improve performance on large tables
3. Note: Indexes take extra storage
4. Indexes may slow down `INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE` because they also need to be updated

### üß± Syntax

```sql
CREATE INDEX index_name
ON table_name (column_name);
```

---

## üß© Types of Indexes

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clustered Index

* Determines **physical order** of data in a table
* Only **one** clustered index per table allowed
* Data rows themselves are stored in the index
* Queries are faster due to order

üìå **Example:** Phone contacts ordered alphabetically ‚Äì data physically follows the index.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Non-Clustered Index

* A separate structure storing column values and **pointers** to actual data
* Multiple non-clustered indexes allowed per table
* Data in the table is **not sorted** by this index

üìå **Example:** Back-of-book index pointing to page numbers

### üîÑ Difference Table

| Feature    | Clustered Index      | Non-Clustered Index         |
| ---------- | -------------------- | --------------------------- |
| Data Order | Physically ordered   | Not physically ordered      |
| Count      | One per table        | Multiple allowed            |
| Structure  | Data stored in index | Index with pointers to rows |
| Speed      | Faster               | Slower than clustered       |

---

## üí° Example: Clustered vs Non-Clustered Index

### Clustered Index on `EmpID`

```text
+--------+----------+---------+
| EmpID  | Name     | Salary  |
+--------+----------+---------+
| 101    | sowmya   | 50000   |
| 102    | ramya    | 60000   |
| 103    | laxmi    | 70000   |
+--------+----------+---------+
```

Data is **physically sorted** by `EmpID`

### Non-Clustered Index on `Salary`

```text
[50000] --> Points to row with EmpID 101
[60000] --> Points to row with EmpID 102
[70000] --> Points to row with EmpID 103
```

Data is **not sorted** by Salary. Index helps lookup.

## üß™ SQL Queries: Views and Indexes

```sql
-- Create database and use it
CREATE DATABASE VIEWS_SP;
USE VIEWS_SP;

-- Create a sample table
CREATE TABLE customers (
   customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,  -- Clustered index
   name VARCHAR(100),
   total_orders INT,
   status VARCHAR(20)
);

-- Insert data
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, total_orders, status) VALUES
(1, 'sowmya', 3, 'active'),
(2, 'navya', 10, 'inactive'),
(3, 'sneha', 6, 'active'),
(4, 'ramya', 7, 'active'),
(5, 'pinky', 2, 'inactive');

-- Query using clustered index (by default on primary key)
SELECT * FROM customers;

-- Create a view
CREATE VIEW top_customers AS
SELECT customer_id, name, total_orders, status FROM customers
WHERE status = 'active' AND total_orders > 5;

-- Query the view
SELECT * FROM top_customers;

-- Create a single-column index (non-clustered)
CREATE INDEX idx_cust_name ON customers(name);

-- Create a multi-column index
CREATE INDEX idx_orders_status ON customers (total_orders, status);

-- Drop an index
DROP INDEX idx_cust_name ON customers;

-- Show indexes
SHOW INDEX FROM customers;

-- Add a primary key later to create clustered index
ALTER TABLE customers
ADD PRIMARY KEY (customer_id);
```

---


## üîç What is a Subquery?

A **subquery** is a query nested inside another SQL query. It is used to return data that will be used in the main (outer) query.

üìå Also called a **nested query** or **inner query**.

### ‚úÖ Where Can You Use Subqueries?

* In the `WHERE` clause
* In the `FROM` clause
* In the `SELECT` clause

### üîß Syntax

```sql
SELECT column_name
FROM table_name
WHERE column_name = (SELECT column_name FROM table_name);
```

### üìå How it Works:

The **inner query** runs **first**, and its result is passed to the **outer query**.

---

## üß† Correlated Subqueries

A **correlated subquery** is a subquery that refers to columns from the outer query. It is executed **once for each row** of the outer query.

### üîÑ Use Case

Used when filtering rows based on calculations that involve the current row of the outer query.

## üß™ Table Setup

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
   id INT PRIMARY KEY,
   name VARCHAR(100),
   department VARCHAR(100),
   salary DECIMAL(10, 2)
);

INSERT INTO employees (id, name, department, salary) VALUES
(1, 'sowmya', 'HR', 50000.00),
(2, 'ramya', 'IT', 50000.00),
(3, 'Chinni', 'Finance', 75000.00),
(4, 'pinky', 'IT', 50000.00),
(5, 'pranavi', 'Marketing', 90000.00);



## üîç Subqueries

-- Employees with salary above average


SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (
   SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees
);

-- Employees in HR department whose name exists in the employee list


SELECT * FROM employees
WHERE department = 'HR'
  AND name IN (SELECT name FROM employees);


-- Employees working in departments where salary is 50000

SELECT name, department
FROM employees
WHERE department IN (
   SELECT department FROM employees WHERE salary = 50000
);


-- Show employee name along with the highest salary in the company


SELECT name, salary,
   (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM employees) AS max_salary
FROM employees;

-- Average salary by department (using subquery as derived table)


SELECT dept_avg.department, dept_avg.avg_salary
FROM (
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
   FROM employees
   GROUP BY department
) AS dept_avg;

---

## üîÑ Correlated Subqueries
-- Employees in IT with salary > department average
SELECT name, department, salary
FROM employees e
WHERE department = 'IT'
  AND salary > (
     SELECT AVG(salary)
     FROM employees
     WHERE department = e.department
);


-- Departments with more than one employee
SELECT DISTINCT department
FROM employees e1
WHERE EXISTS (
   SELECT 1
   FROM employees e2
   WHERE e1.department = e2.department
     AND e1.id <> e2.id
);
```

## üìò What is a Stored Procedure?

A **Stored Procedure** is a group of SQL statements saved in the database, which you can run repeatedly by calling its name.

### ‚úÖ Simple Definition:

* Like a function in SQL
* Created once and reused multiple times
* Useful for tasks like inserting, updating, deleting, and calculations

---

## üßæ Syntax

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name()
BEGIN
    -- SQL statements here
END //
DELIMITER ;
```

---

## üß™ Examples

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Stored Procedure to List All Employees

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE list_employees()
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Call the stored procedure
CALL list_employees();
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Stored Procedure to Get Employee by ID

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE get_employee_by_id(IN emp_id INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT * FROM employees WHERE id = emp_id;
END //
DELIMITER ;

-- Call the stored procedure
CALL get_employee_by_id(3);
```

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Drop a Stored Procedure

```sql
DROP PROCEDURE IF EXISTS get_employee_by_id;
```
