# Introduction to Programming and Java

## 1. Purpose of Programming Languages

The main purpose of any programming language is to solve a problem.

## 2. Components of a Computer

Computer contains keyboard, mouse, monitor, CPU, etc. â€” these are peripheral devices that help us interact with the system.

## 3. What is a Computer?

A computer is essentially a processor, holding system data like Word, Notepad, graphics, etc.

## 4. Operating Systems

Operating system is a way to interact with the processor. Examples:

* DOS Commands
* Command Prompt
* Windows
* Mac
* Linux

Each OS has unique capabilities.

## 5. Ways to Interact with the Processor

To meet custom computing needs (e.g., checking student exam results), we can either:

1. Interact directly with the processor.
2. Use a programming language that acts as a middle layer.

*Analogy: Watching a movie in an unknown language with subtitles.*

## 6. Binary Language

Computers only understand binary (0s and 1s). Since humans can't communicate in binary, we use languages like:

* C
* C++
* Java
* Python
* .NET
* Data Science

Older languages like COBOL, Pascal are deprecated.

## 7. Why Java?

Compared to C/C++, Java offers:

* OOP Concepts
* Platform Independence
* Garbage Collection
* No Pointers

*Analogy: A â‚¹7,000 phone with 10k features vs. one with 15k features â€” choose more features!*

## 8. Language Strengths

* C: No OOP
* C++: OOP, but platform-dependent
* Java: OOP and platform-independent
* Python: Strong in web applications

## 9. What is a Platform?

**Platform = OS + Processor**

## 10. Programming Language Keywords

Keywords are mostly English-based, but conceptually can be in any language.

## 11. What is Source Code?

Human-readable code written by developers.

## 12. Role of the Compiler

Converts source code to binary (0s, 1s). Compiler is platform-independent.

## 13. OS and Processor Compatibility

Different OS and processor combinations (e.g., Mac OS with Windows chip) can complicate compilation.

## 14. Java's Advantage: Compile Once, Run Anywhere

Java compiles code to an **intermediate** file (Byte-code) that can run on any platform.

## 15. Byte-code in Java

* Generated by compiling `.java` files
* Independent of OS and processor
* `.class` files are byte-code

### Compilation Flow

```text
Source Code (.java)
        â†“
     Compiler
        â†“
   Byte-code (.class)
        â†“
       JVM (Windows/Linux/Mac)
        â†“
   Machine Code
```

## 16. Java Compilation vs. Other Languages

Java generates Byte-code first; interpreter later converts it to machine code.

*Analogy: Java is like cooked food (ready to eat); C++ is raw ingredients.*

## 17. Interpreter in Java

Executes byte-code instructions.

## 18. Platform vs. JVM

* **Compiler** creates byte-code â†’ Platform Independent
* **JVM** interprets byte-code â†’ Platform Dependent

## 19. JVM, javac, JDK, JRE

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

* Converts Byte-code â†’ Machine Code
* Platform dependent
* Executes programs

### javac (Java Compiler)

* Converts source code â†’ Byte-code
* Platform independent
* Not part of JRE

### JDK (Java Development Kit)

* Tools for development (includes JRE + compiler)

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

* Tools for running Java programs (includes JVM + libraries)

## 20. Summary of Java Compilation

* Compile Java file â†’ Byte-code
* Byte-code â†’ Interpreted by JVM
* Compiler is platform independent
* JVM is platform dependent

## 21. Libraries

Libraries are reusable code files for specific tasks.

## ðŸ”‘ Important Points to Remember

1. Java is platform-independent (Byte-code runs on any JVM).
2. C++ allows direct use of pointers.
3. Byte-code is the output of the Java compiler.
4. Byte-code = Platform-independent intermediate code.
5. JVM is platform-dependent.
6. Use `javac` and `java` from any directory via PATH setup.
7. Compiler converts source code to byte-code.
8. Java uses compilation â†’ byte-code â†’ interpretation by JVM.
9. Java compiler is not included in JRE.
10. JRE is part of the JDK.
