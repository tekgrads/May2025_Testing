SQL Injection & Importance of PreparedStatement in Java
💥 What is SQL Injection?
SQL Injection is a security vulnerability that allows attackers to interfere with SQL queries executed by an application. It usually happens when user input is directly inserted into SQL statements without proper sanitization.

Attackers can:

Bypass authentication

Access unauthorized data

Delete or modify data

Execute administrative operations

⚠️ Vulnerable Example: Using Statement (Not Recommended)
java
Copy
Edit
String user = request.getParameter("username");
String pass = request.getParameter("password");

Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user + "' AND password = '" + pass + "'";
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
🧨 Attacker Input:
plaintext
Copy
Edit
username: admin
password: ' OR '1'='1
🔍 Final Executed Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';
💣 '1'='1' is always true, so the attacker bypasses login.

🚨 Dangers of SQL Injection
✅ Bypass authentication

📝 Data theft or leakage

✏️ Unauthorized INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE

🗑️ DROP tables/databases

🔐 Security breach of server

✅ Safe Approach: Use PreparedStatement
🔐 Secure Example
java
Copy
Edit
String user = request.getParameter("username");
String pass = request.getParameter("password");

String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, user);
pstmt.setString(2, pass);

ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
🔍 Key Benefits
? = placeholders (parameter markers)

Input is auto-escaped and sanitized

Query is precompiled, so SQL logic can't be changed

⚙️ Statement vs PreparedStatement
Feature	Statement (❌)	PreparedStatement (✅)
User input concatenated?	✅ Yes	❌ No
Query parsed every time?	✅ Yes	❌ No (Precompiled)
Prevents SQL Injection?	❌ Vulnerable	✅ Safe
Better performance?	❌	✅ Yes (cached query plan)
Easy to maintain?	❌	✅ Clean separation

🧠 Summary
Point	PreparedStatement Advantage
Prevents SQL Injection	✅ Escapes input automatically
Performance Boost	✅ Precompiled, faster reuse
Cleaner Code	✅ Clear separation of query/data
No manual escaping needed	✅ Internally handled

# 🔐 SQL Injection & Importance of PreparedStatement in Java

---

## 💥 What is SQL Injection?

SQL Injection is a **security vulnerability** that allows attackers to interfere with the SQL queries executed by an application.  
It occurs when **user input is directly embedded** into a query string, enabling malicious manipulation of the logic.

---

## ⚠️ Vulnerable Example (Using `Statement`)

```java
String user = request.getParameter("username");
String pass = request.getParameter("password");

Statement stmt = conn.createStatement();
String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '" + user + "' AND password = '" + pass + "'";
ResultSet rs = stmt.executeQuery(query);
🧨 Malicious Input:
pgsql
Copy
Edit
username: admin  
password: ' OR '1'='1
🔍 Final Query:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'admin' AND password = '' OR '1'='1';
✅ The condition '1'='1' always evaluates to true, so attackers bypass authentication.

🛑 Dangers of SQL Injection
Unauthorized login or data access

Data manipulation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)

Data leakage

Dropping tables or entire databases (DROP TABLE users;)

Full system compromise

✅ Solution: Use PreparedStatement
🔐 Safe Example (Using PreparedStatement)
java
Copy
Edit
String user = request.getParameter("username");
String pass = request.getParameter("password");

String query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ? AND password = ?";
PreparedStatement pstmt = conn.prepareStatement(query);
pstmt.setString(1, user);
pstmt.setString(2, pass);

ResultSet rs = pstmt.executeQuery();
? are placeholders for user input

Input values are escaped and sanitized automatically

Prevents any embedded SQL logic from being executed

⚙️ Comparison: Statement vs PreparedStatement
Feature	Statement ❌	PreparedStatement ✅
User input concatenated?	✅ Yes	❌ No
Query parsed once?	❌ Every execution	✅ Precompiled once
SQL Injection protection	❌ Vulnerable	✅ Safe
Performance (repeated queries)	❌ Low	✅ High

🧠 Summary: Why Use PreparedStatement?
Point	Benefit
Prevents SQL Injection	✅ Escapes special characters
Improves Performance	✅ Caches and reuses execution plan
Easier to Read & Maintain	✅ Separates query logic and data clearly
No Manual Escaping Required	✅ Input is handled and sanitized internally
