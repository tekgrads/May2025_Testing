## 1. What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** used for tracking changes in computer files.  
We are using Git because it is **free of cost**.

- Git tracks changes in the source code.
- It is the most commonly used version control system.
- Git records what has been done and allows you to revert to previous versions if needed.
- It enables collaboration by allowing changes from multiple people to be merged into one source.

## 2. Centralized Repositories

Central repositories help manage dependencies and make it easy to combine code changes from different developers.

- They act as the **main source of truth** for a project.
- Ensures everyone uses the **same version** of the code.

## 3. Clone

When you **clone** a repository, you copy it from GitHub.com to your local machine.

- Cloning pulls down a **full copy** of all the repository data, including:
  - All versions of every file and folder
  - Complete project history

## 4. Stage, Unstage, Commit, Push

### ‚úÖ Stage

The **staging area** is like a waiting room for your changes.

- You use it to tell Git **which files** to include in the next commit.
- Gives control over the project history.

### üîÅ Unstage

**Unstaging** removes files from the staging area:

- Ensures the file will **not** be part of the next commit.
- Optionally, you can discard local changes too.

### üíæ Commit

A **commit** is like a save point:

- Records a **snapshot** of your files with a message.
- You can **revert** to a previous commit if needed.

### üöÄ Push

**Push** uploads local commits to a remote repository:

- Transfers changes to GitHub or another Git server.

## 5. Branching Strategies

Branches are **independent lines of work**, stemming from the original codebase.

- Used to work on features independently.
- Prevents changes from interfering with each other.
- Developers can **pull, merge, and collaborate** efficiently.

## 6. Process: Pushing Code/File to GitHub Using GitHub Desktop

1. Click **"Set up in Desktop"** on GitHub.
2. **Clone** in GitHub Desktop.
3. Copy required files into the **cloned folder**.
4. Use GitHub Desktop to **commit to main**.
5. Click **Publish branch** to upload your files to GitHub.

---

## 7. Pull Request (PR)

A **Pull Request (PR)** is a proposal to merge changes from one branch into another.

-In a pull request, collaborators can review and discuss the proposed set of changes before they integrate the changes into the main codebase.
