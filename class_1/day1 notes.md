# Introduction to Programming and Java

## 1. Purpose of Programming Languages
The main purpose of any programming language is to solve a problem.

## 2. Components of a Computer
Computer contains keyboard, mouse, monitor, CPU, etc. — these are peripheral devices that help us interact with the system.

## 3. What is a Computer?
A computer is essentially a processor, holding system data like Word, Notepad, graphics, etc.

## 4. Operating Systems
Operating system is a way to interact with the processor. Examples:
- DOS Commands
- Command Prompt
- Windows
- Mac
- Linux

Each OS has unique capabilities.

## 5. Ways to Interact with the Processor
To meet custom computing needs (e.g., checking student exam results), we can either:
1. Interact directly with the processor.
2. Use a programming language that acts as a middle layer.

Analogy: Watching a movie in an unknown language with subtitles.

## 6. Binary Language
Computers only understand binary (0s and 1s). Since humans can't communicate in binary, we use languages like:
- C
- C++
- Java
- Python
- .NET
- Data Science

Older languages like COBOL, Pascal are deprecated.

## 7. Why Java?
Compared to C/C++, Java offers:
- OOP Concepts
- Platform Independence
- Garbage Collection
- No Pointers

Analogy: A ₹7,000 phone with 10k features vs. one with 15k features — choose more features!

## 8. Language Strengths
- C: No OOP
- C++: OOP, but platform-dependent
- Java: OOP and platform-independent
- Python: Strong in web applications

## 9. What is a Platform?
**Platform = OS + Processor**

## 10. Programming Language Keywords
Keywords are mostly English-based, but conceptually can be in any language.

## 11. What is Source Code?
Human-readable code written by developers.

## 12. Role of the Compiler
Converts source code to binary (0s, 1s). Compiler is platform-independent.

## 13. OS and Processor Compatibility
Different OS and processor combinations (e.g., Mac OS with Windows chip) can complicate compilation.

## 14. Java's Advantage: Compile Once, Run Anywhere
Java compiles code to an **intermediate** file (Byte-code) that can run on any platform.

## 15. Byte-code in Java
- Generated by compiling `.java` files
- Independent of OS and processor
- `.class` files are byte-code
