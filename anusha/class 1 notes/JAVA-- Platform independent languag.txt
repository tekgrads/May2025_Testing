JAVA-- Platform independent language 
The main purpose of any programming language is to solve problem
WHY JAVA?
compared to C,C++ JAVA have more features, in java we have OOPS concepts, java has garbage collectors. Java doesn't have pointers.
C,C+ have there own pro's and con's. There are certain areas where java is very strong, there are certain areas where C,C+ are strong.
on c language we don't have OOPS concepts
What exactly java is trying to solve?
C and C++ are powerful languages but have major drawbacks like platform dependency which is why
Java was introduced to overcome them with features like JVM and platform independence.
Java was designed to solve platform dependency issues found in C/C++. It allows developers to write
code once and run it anywhere.

Platform=Operating system + processor

Byte-code is the intermediatory code generated after compiling java source-code.
Byte-code is the primary output of the java compiler
Byte-code in java means platform-independent independent intermediate code

JDK – Java Development Kit (Developer side)
It is a full software development kit to write, compile, and run Java programs
JRE – Java Runtime Environment (Client side)
It is only for running Java programs. You can’t compile programs with JRE. 

For compilation we use - javac filename.java
For execution - java filename 

javac - compiler(generates byte code) always platform independent
java - interpreter (JVM) platform independent
Why Path Environment setup is required?
Else cmd prompt will look for other directories

Libraries- set of files which can do particular tasks.
