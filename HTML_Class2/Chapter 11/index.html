What are Semantic Tags?
Semantic tags add meaning to your HTML. They tell both the browser and the developer what kind of content is being presented.

Here are some of the key semantic tags you must know about:

<header>: Used to represent the top section of a web page, often containing headings, logos, and navigation.
<nav>: Signifies a navigation menu on a web page.
<article>: Indicates a self-contained piece of content, such as a blog post or news article.
<section>: Represents a thematic grouping of content on a web page.
<aside>: Typically used for sidebars or content that is tangentially related to the main content.
<footer>: Represents the footer of a web page, usually containing copyright information and contact details.
<figure> and <figcaption>: Used for embedding images, diagrams, or charts, along with a caption.
<main>: Signifies the main content area of a web page.
<time>: Used to represent time-related information, like dates and times.
