## 1. Why Java when there is already C++?

- **Platform Independence**  
- **Bytecode and JVM**  
- **Reusability through OOP**  
- **Automatic Memory Management**  

---

## 2. How to Set Up JDK

1. Download JDK from Oracle or OpenJDK website.  
2. Install JDK on your system.  
3. Set `JAVA_HOME` environment variable.  
4. Add JDK's `bin` directory to system `PATH`.  
5. Verify installation using `java -version` in terminal.

## 3. Environment Variables

Environment variables are system-wide settings that define configuration values, like paths and system behavior.

- In Java, variables like `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` help the system locate the JDK and run Java programs.  
- Think of them as **global shortcuts** to important tools or files.  
- `JAVA_HOME` helps tools locate the JDK.  
- `PATH` allows you to run Java commands from anywhere in the terminal.

## 4. JDK vs JRE vs JVM ‚Äî *A Kitchen Analogy*

| Term    | Analogy         | Explanation                                                        |
|---------|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **JVM** | Microwave        | It runs (heats) your Java program (food).                         |
| **JRE** | Kitchen          | Includes the microwave and items to serve food, but not cook new recipes. |
| **JDK** | Cooking School   | Full setup to create new dishes: kitchen + recipes + utensils (compiler, debugger, etc). |
