01. What is an identifier?
  - A name of a programming element is technically called as identifier
  - It means a class name, variable name, method name are commonly called identifier

02. Why identifier?
  - for accessing a class or a variable or a method from other methods of same class
    or from other classes methods, we must use name.

  - if PE does not have name we can not access it from other PEs.

03. What will happen if we create a PE without name?
  - it leads to CE: <identifier> expected

	For example:   
          class  {
               int = 10;
 
               void (){ 

               }
          }
