01. What is Java?
	- Java is a Platform Independent
	  Object-Oriented programming language.
	  
02. Why Java is invented?	  
	- Java was invented to achieve Platform Independency
	  for developing internet based business application

03. Differences b/w C, C++, Python and Java?
	- Java was invented after C, C++ and Python

	- C and C++ PLs are platform dependent, they can be used 
	  only for developing stand-alone applications

	- Python is manily invented for developing game applications
	  with scripting style programming. It have more libraries
	  for doing mathmatical calculations, it does not have 
	  libraries for developing business applications
	
	- Hence for develop business applications and for accessing 
	  them through internet Java is invented

	- Nowdays in applications development both Java and Python 
	  are being used
   	   - Java is used for developing main appliction of the business
	   - Python is used for developing Data Science, ML and AI based applictions
	    
	   - For example: 
		- Google apps, Amazon, Bank Applications are developed by using Java

                - AI tools -> Chatgpt, Google Assistant, Recommandation system, 
		  etc.. are developed by using Python. Instagram is develop by using 
		  Python and its frameword dJango.

	- Where ever data searching and analization is required 
	  there python is used because it has more 'mathmatical' libraries
	  but not for business main application development

	- For developing one complete application for a business 
	  for reading data from user and for display a business products, 
	  Java is used.

04. Who invented Java?
	- Java was invented by Mr. James Gosling
	  in SUN Microsytems in the year 1991
	  for developing network based applications
	  
	- The first version of Java 1.0 is relased 
	  in the year 1995

05. Types of applications?
	- All available softwares or projects or applications
	  are broadly divided into 2 types
		1. Stand-alone applications
		2. Internet applications

	- An application that is installed in one computer
	  and can be accessible only with in this computer
	  and can't be accessible from remote computers via 
	  network is called stand-alone application

		For example: 
		  Calculator, MS-Office, Antivirus, VLC, Game SWs... are SA.
		  
	 
	
	- An application that is installed in one computer
	  and can be accessible from remote computers throughout 
	  the world via network is called internet application
	  
		For example:
		  Amazon, irctc, instagam, bookmyshow, youtube, gmail,
		  
	 
	- A  SA is a single computer and single user application
	- An IA is a multi computer and multi user application
     
	   Q1) Is browser a SA or IA?
		- SA, because we install it in our computer
		  and access it with in our computer 
		  
	   Q2) Is mobile app a SA or IA?
		- SA, because we install it in our mobile
		  and access it with in our mobile 

		- For example: 
		   - The whatsapp app, insta app, gmail app, youtube app
		     installed in your mobile are stand-alone apps
               
	           - The the programs/the project available at server 
		     and send data to display on the above mobile apps 
		     are internet application
