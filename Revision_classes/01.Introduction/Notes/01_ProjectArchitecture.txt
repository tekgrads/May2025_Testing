01. What is the project architecture?
	- Different layers or parts available in a project is called
	  project architecture
	  
	- Every project is divided in to 3 layers or parts
		1. UI (User Interface)
		2. Programming
		3. Data Base
		
	- User Interface 
	   - UI is responsible to 
		1. reading inputs from user and sending to programming layer and 
		2. gathering output from the programming layer and display to user
	
	   - Hence UI has two parts 'Forms and Reports'
		1. Forms   -> for reading input from user 
		2. Reports -> for displaying output to user 

	- Programming
	   - Programming layer is responsible 
		1. for reading inputs from UI
		2. performing validations and calculations
		3. generating results with the given inputs and 
		4. throwing exceptions if inputs are wrong
	     
	   - Hence Programming has three parts
		1. Validations     -> to check given values are correct or wrong
		2. Calculations    -> to generate results
		3. throwing errors -> when wrong values are passed 
	  
	- Data Base  
	   - Data base is responsible to store data permanently
	     later read, update and delete that data permanently
	     
	   - Hence Data base has two parts
		1. Tables	-> for storing data
		2. Procedures	-> for performing operations on stored data

	  
02. What is Full Stack Java?
	- The process of developing one full project 
	  end-to-end is called Full Stack Development 
	
03. What is the meaning of end-to-end project?
	- A project's one end is UI and other end is DB
	
	- Developing a project from UI to programming to Data base
	  is called Full Stack Development
	  
04. What is Full Stack Java Development?
	- Developing a project by using Java and its frameworks 
	  is called Full Stack Java Development
	  
05. How many different Full Stack Developments do we have?
	- We have 5 different full stack developments
		1. Full Stack Java, SpringBoot Development
		2. Full Stack Python, dJango Development
		3. Full Stack Python, Data Science Development
		4. Full Stack .Net Development
		5. Full Stack UI Development

         - For all types of full stacks front-end UI is developed 
           by using HTML, CSS, JS, BS and React
	
06. What is Full Stack Java Developer?
	- A single developer who can develop complete project
	  UI screens, Programs and Data base by using 
	  Java and Spring Boot is called Full Stack Developer
