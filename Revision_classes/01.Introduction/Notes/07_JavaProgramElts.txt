Java Programming Elements
-------------------------------------------------

	Java supports 8 programming elements
	==============================================================================
	Progrmming Elements		purpose
	==============================================================================
 	  1. Module		-> for grouping packages
	  2. Package		-> for grouping classes
	  3. Class		-> for representing RWO in PW
	  			   and for grouping variables and methods
	  4. Variables		-> for representing values and allocating memory 
	  5. Methods		-> for representing operations
	  6. Constructors	-> for storing values on variables
	  7. Blocks		-> also for storing values in variables
	  8. Inner classes	-> for representing inner object of an outer object	
	=================================================================================	
	
. Essential statements to develop, compile, execute and print some message on console?
	- We have 3 essential statements	
		1. class			-> for developing and compiling
		2. main method			-> for executing
		3. System.out.println(-);	-> for printing a value or message
	
	- The class is essential because Java is an OOP langauge,
	  hence every program must starts with a class
	
	- The main method is essential because main method is the 
	  initial point of execution of a class. JVM executes a class
	  starts with main method.
	  	Note: if class does not have main method,  
		      JVM throws error: 'main method not found'

	- The System.out.println(-); is essential because 
	  in Java we can print any value or message only by using
	  System.out.println(-);

 Java program structure
	- class contains main method, 
	  main method contains S.o.println()  statement

	class  <classname>  {

		main method {
			System.out.println("message");	
		}
	}
		
 Steps to develop a Java program?		
    - Java program develop, compilation and execition
      comes under 7 steps
	1. Open editplus
	2. Type Java code
	3. Save this progarm with .java extension

	4. Open command prompt
	5. Change drive and directory path 
	   to the project directory in which 
	   java program is saved
	
	6. Compile java program by usign 'javac' tool
	7. Execute byte code by using 'java' tool	 


	
. Compilation and Execution procedure
     Compilation
     ===========
        - Converting source code to bytecode and 
	  saving in bytecode in a new file with .class exetension
	  is called compilation
	- We compile a Java program by using compiler sofware 'javac' tool
	- The command for compilation 
		javac filename.java
	- Compiler produces byte code and saved in 
	  .class file with classname as file name
	- for example:
		javac  Example.java
		  |->FirstProgram.class
 
      Execution
      ==========	
        - Running Java byecode and generating output is called execution
	- We run a Java program by using JVM by using 'java' tool
	- JVM takes byte code from .class file
	- The command for execution
		java  classname
	- JVM runs a class starts with main method and displays output
	- For example:
		java  FirstProgram
		  |-> HKProgrammingWorld



   class Test {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
 	 System.out.println("HelloWorld!");
      }	
   }
	
 - In the above program the words 'class, public, static, void' are keywords. 
   We must use them with all letters lower case, becuse they are created in 
   Java language with all letters lower case.
  
 - The name 'main' is not a keyword, it is just a name of the method.
   we must also use the all letters lower case, because it is also
   predefined name
  
 - The names 'String, System' are predefined class names  
   which are available as part of JDK software. We must use them
   with first letter capital letter.
  
 - The names 'Test and args' are user defined names
   we can use either same name or different name 
   either with small letters or capital letters its our wish
   but we can not use space in between words.
  
 - It is recommanded to place '{' in the same line of class and method
   creation, we can place it in next line, but it is C language syntax style.
  
. Types of errors occured in the program
	- In a program we will get 2 types of errors
		1. Compiletime Errors	(CEs)
		2. Runtime Errors	(REs)
    
	- An error that is occurred during a program compilation
	  is called comile time error. A CE is occurred due to 
	  syntax mistakes (wrong typing or wrong spelling). 
	  The Compiler throws CEs.
		For example: placing a statement without ends with ;
		             is a syntax mistake
    
	- An error that is occurred during a program execition
	  is called runtime error. A RE is occurred due to 
	  logical mistakes (wrong value or wrong logic). 
	  The JVM throws REs.
		For example: main method is not avilable in the class
		             is a logical mistake
