 Types of Java software?
	Java has two types of softwares
		1. JDK 
		2. JRE
		
	
 Difference between JDK, JRE and JVM?
      JDK  
	- JDK stands for Java Developement Kit.
	- It provides development tool compiler, runtime envronment JVM and API
	- Hence by using JDK software we can develop, compile and execute new 
	  program also can modify existing programs
	- In developer computer we must install JDK   
	 
      JRE  
	- JRE stands for Java Runtime Environent.
	- It provides only runtime envronment JVM and API
	- Hence by using JRE software we can only execute existing programs
	- In Client/Customer computer we must install JRE
	
      JVM
	- JVM stands for Java Virtual Machine.
	- It is a Java platform, its translation software
	- It is responsible for running Java bytecode by converting it into 
	  current OS machine language 
      
    Why public JRE is removed in Java 11v?
	- In modren web applications development
	  the client UI prages are developed by using
	  HTML, CSS and Java script or React, for running
	  HTML pages JRE is not required just Browser is sufficent
	  
	- Hence JRE is not being used in a client system
	  so it is removed in Java 11v
	
	- From Java 11v onwards we have 
	  only one Java software that is JDK
	  
12. Downloading and Jnstalling JDK-21v software? 	
	1. Open Browser
	2. Type 'JDK 21 download', press enter
	3. Click 'Java Downloads'-> JDK download page will be shown
	4. Scroll down the page -> Click JDK 21-> Click Windows  
	5. Click 'jdk.exe' file link, download is started
	
	6. After downloading is completed
	
	7. Click on JDK.exe file -> click yes -> Click Next
	8. Click 'Change' -> remove 'Program Files\Java\' carefully
	   make path as 'C:\jdk-22\' -> Click Ok
	9. Click 'Next' -> installation is completed -> click 'Close'
	10. JDK software is installed in 'C:\jdk-21'
	    This folder is called JAVA_HOME

    - Test whether JDK is running or not?
    	- Open command prompt [press start -> type cmd -> press enter]

	- Type the command 'javac  -version' press enter
	   it must display javac 21.0.x

	- Type the command 'java  -version' press enter
	   it must display java version "21.0.x" 
	
    - JDK software is installed and running successfully
    - Now we can develop programs

13. Softwares required to 'develop, compile and execute' a Java program?
	- We need three softwares
	  1. Editor		-> for developing a java program
				   for [typing and saving] a program
					   
	  2. JDK		-> for obtaining [Compiler and JVM] into our system
				   and for [Compiling and Running] our program
					   
	  3. Command prompt	-> for running 'Compiler and JVM' softwares 
		                   for compiling and running our Java program


	- Different Editor sofwares
	   1. Basic editor	   -> Notepad
	   2. Advanced editors	   -> Notepad++, Textpad, Editplus, Brackets, ...
	   3. More Adv Editors[IDE]-> Eclipse, IntelliJ, STS, VS Code, ..........
