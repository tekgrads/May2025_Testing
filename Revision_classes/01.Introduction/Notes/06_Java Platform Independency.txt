How Java achieved PI?
	- In Java, program is not compiled targetting to any particular OS,
	  Hence, the Java compiled code does not contain 'Machine Lanaguge code'.

	- Java program is compiled into bytecode, 
	  which is an intermediate language of all OS

	- Then later this byte code is executed by JVM 
	  by translating it into the current OS's ML code
	  in which we are running this Java program
	  
	- Because we have separate JVM for every OS for running Java bytecode,
	  the same compiled code, byte code, is executed in all OS 
	  with the help of JVM

	- Hence Java achieved PI, that is WORA(Write Once Run Anywhere).
