What is a Platform, Platform dependency, Platform independency?
     Platform
      - A platform is a runtime environment in which a program is loaded & executed. 
      - A platform can be software only platform or hardware only platform or both. 
     
      - A computer platform is both software and hardware based platform 
        that is OS, processor and hardware devices (ram and hard disk) 
 
      - A 'C and C++' programs platform is OS, it means 
        'C and C++' programs are executed by OS directly

      - A Java program platform is 'JVM', It means 
       Java programs are not executed OS, they are executed 
       by one special intermediate software called 'JVM'. 
       
	- Java program platform is JVM and JVM platform is OS 

      - A Python program  platform is 'PVM'.
      - A .Net   program  platform is 'CLR'.
      - A HTML   page     platform is 'Browser'.
      - A audio and video files    platform is 'Media player(VLC)'.

     Platform Dependency
      - A program that is developed in one OS, ex: windows,
        if it can not execute in a different OS, ex: Linux or Mac,
        We call this program as platform dependent program
       
      - The programming language using which we develop this program 
        is called platform dependent programming language  


     Platform Independency
      - A program that is developed in one OS, ex: windows,
        if it can be executed in different OS, ex: Linux or Mac, 
        We call this program as platform independent program
       
      - The programming language using which we develop this program 
        is called platform independent programming language.  

	
      - If a program or a software is directly executed by OS,
        then this program or software is a platform dependent 
	program and platform dependent software
	
      - If a program is executed by an intemediate software like 
        JVM, PVM, CLR, Browser, then this program is a platform independent program

07. Why C and C++ PLs are platform dependent?
	- The C and C++ programs are compiled targetting to one particular OS

	- Hence C and C++ programs compiled code contains ML of
	  a particular OS whose format is not understandable to differnt OS
	  and can not be executed by different OS, so C and C++ programs are 
	  called platform dependent
