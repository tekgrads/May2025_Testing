 new keyword
============

We do not apply 'new' keyword to each variable separately
	2. It provides memory to all variables as one group
	3. It can provide memory to variables multiple copies
	   as many times as we use 'new' keyword in the logic
	   those many copies will be provided to the same variables
	   declared in the class.
	4. To all variables memory is provided as one group







13. Below program shows providing memory by using 'new' keyword	
		1. inside the class, donot declare variables as static
		   leave them as non-static
		   
		2. in main method use new keyword to provide memory 
		   to those non-static variables created inside this class

	//Example.java
	class Example {

		int		i1 = 5;
		double	d1 = 6.7;
		char	ch = 'a';
		long[]	la = {8, 9};
		String	s1 = "Hari";		

		public static void main(String[] args) {
			//variable			object(group of variables and their values  
			//	|				   |				of class Example)
			// \|/				  \|/
			Example    e1	  =  new Example();	    
			
			//printing object
			System.out.println(e1);			//Example@1010   <- ClassName@hashcode
			
			//reading and printing object values
			System.out.println(e1.i1);		//5
			System.out.println(e1.d1);		//6.7
			System.out.println(e1.ch);		//a
			System.out.println(e1.la);		//[J@2020
			System.out.println(e1.la[0]);	//8
			System.out.println(e1.la[1]);	//9
			System.out.println(e1.s1);		//Hari
		}
	}
