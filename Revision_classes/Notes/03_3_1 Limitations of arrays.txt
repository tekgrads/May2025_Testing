Limitation of Array
==================

	Array can store only same type of values

	It doesnot allows us to store different type of values
	Higher range values or incompatible values are not allowed to store

	For example:
	  in an int[] we can store only int type or its lesser type values
	  because in int[] we will have all locations are of same type int
		
      we can no store long or float or double or boolean or String values
	  we will get CE, because in int variable we cannot store them
