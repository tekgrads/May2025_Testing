    What is a datatype?
====================
                A keyword that is used for creating a variable for storing single value or multiple values as one group is called a datatype.
                 In java  we cannot create a varaiable or object without using datatype. It leads to compile time error.
                 for example
                                  class Test{
                                                    a = 10;  // CE
                                                    void m1(){
                                                         b = 20;   //CE : cannot find symbol
                                                      }
                                              }
            Types of data types
=======================
 - Java supports 2 types of database 
	1. Primitive Data types (8)
	2. Referenced Data types (8)

 - Primitive Data types are keywords, 
     they are used for creating a variable 
	 for storing single value

 - Referenced Data types are 'array or class', 
     they are used for creating an object 
	 for storing multiple values as one group

Primitive datatypes
===================================
					
1. byte
2. short
3. int
4. long
5. float
6. double
char
boolean


Referenced DataTypes
======================
1.  Array
2.  class
            i.     interface
            ii.   abstract class
            iii.  concrete class
           iv.   final class
           v.    enum
           vi.  annotation   etc  

3.  String
