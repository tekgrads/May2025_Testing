# Git Basics and Workflow

## 1. What is Git?

Git is a **version control system** designed to track changes in files, particularly code.  
We use Git because it's **free and widely adopted** in the software industry.

- Keeps a record of all code modifications.
- Allows reverting to previous versions if needed.
- Supports **collaboration** by enabling multiple developers to work together and merge their contributions.

## 2. Centralized Repositories

A **central repository** serves as the main hub for a project.

- Simplifies dependency management and code integration.
- Ensures everyone works with the **same version** of the codebase.
- Acts as the **source of truth** for all project contributors.

## 3. Cloning a Repository

**Cloning** means copying a repository from a remote server (like GitHub) to your local machine.

- Brings down the entire project history.
- Includes **all versions of files and directories**.
- Creates a local environment for development.

## 4. Git Workflow: Stage, Unstage, Commit, Push

### ‚úÖ Stage

- The staging area is a **preparation zone** for your changes.
- You select specific files to include in the next commit.
- Helps maintain a clean and organized project history.

### üîÅ Unstage

- Removes files from the staging area.
- Ensures those files won't be included in the upcoming commit.
- Optionally allows you to discard changes made locally.

### üíæ Commit

- A **commit** is a recorded snapshot of your files.
- Includes a message describing what was changed.
- Lets you roll back to this point if needed.

### üöÄ Push

- Sends your committed changes to a **remote repository** (e.g., GitHub).
- Makes your updates accessible to other collaborators.

## 5. Branching Strategies

**Branches** allow developers to work on separate features or fixes independently.

- Prevents conflicts between different sets of changes.
- Facilitates collaboration and experimentation.
- Supports **parallel development workflows**.

## 6. Uploading Code Using GitHub Desktop

1. On GitHub, click **"Set up in Desktop"**.
2. Clone the repository using **GitHub Desktop**.
3. Add or move your files into the cloned project folder.
4. Use GitHub Desktop to **commit changes to the main branch**.
5. Click **Publish Branch** to upload your changes to GitHub.

## 7. Pull Requests (PRs)

A **Pull Request (PR)** is
