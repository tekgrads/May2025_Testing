Programming Languages are used to complete users task.
Python provides easier syntax and faster prototyping.
C/C++ is sed for system-level and performance-critical applications.
Java is used for full stack development, Enterprise environments and large applications.

What is Java?
Java is a popular procedural and object-oriented programming language. It was created in 1995 and is owned by Oracle.
Java is a secure, fast, and powerful programming language. Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.). It has huge community support.
Java is an platform independent.

Why to choose java over other programming languages?
Java is a popular programming language because it offers platform independence through its bytecode and JVM, allowing programs to run on any device without modification.
Java is platform independent, strong typing, performance, enterprise support. Java has rich ecosystem, scalability, security.
Widely used in enterprise environments, Java scales well for large applications and maintains backward compatibility, ensuring older code continues to work with newer versions.

Java Installation - 
Go to chrome and search 'download java'.
Download JDK 24 version.
To check installation go to cmd prompt and type "java --version".
Set the system environment(environmental variables -> path).
There are two types - User variable and System variable.
Add bin path on system variable

Byte Code - Is a source of everything
Bytecode is the compiled form of your .java source code file.
When you compile a Java program using javac, the Java compiler translates the code into bytecode, which is stored in a class file.
This bytecode is platform-independent.

Intrepreter - An interpreter is a type of program that reads and executes code line by line, rather than compiling the entire code into machine language at once.
It translates high-level code (like Python, JavaScript, etc.) into machine code, but one line at a time.

JVM(Java virtual machine) - The engine that runs Java bytecode.
Process of Converting byte code to machine understandable code.
JVM is a part of JRE.

JRE(Java runtime environment) - It is a package of JVM, java class libraries, files.
Provides the runtime environment to run Java applications.

JDK(Java development kit) - A full development package for Java developers.
JDK is a full development package for java developers.
JDK includes JRE, java compiler, debugger and other development tools.
