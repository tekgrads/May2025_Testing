# 🧠 Git and GitHub - Explained for Beginners

## 🔧 What is Git?

**Git** is a **version control system** that helps track changes in your code and collaborate with others.

### ✅ What Git does:
- Saves snapshots of your project (called **commits**).
- Lets you go back to earlier versions.
- Allows you to create **branches** to try new features safely.
- Helps multiple developers work together.

### 💡 Think of Git as:
> A smart time machine for your code.

### 👨‍💻 Common Git Commands:

| Command                     | Description                           |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `git init`                  | Start a Git repository                 |
| `git status`                | Show file changes                     |
| `git add filename`          | Stage a file for commit               |
| `git commit -m "Message"`   | Save a snapshot with a message        |
| `git log`                   | View commit history                   |
| `git branch`                | List or create branches               |
| `git merge branch-name`     | Merge a branch into the current one   |

## 🌐 What is GitHub?

**GitHub** is a **website** that hosts your Git repositories **online**.

### ✅ What GitHub does:
- Stores your code in the cloud.
- Lets you share your project with others.
- Supports collaboration through pull requests, issues, etc.
- Tracks contributions and project activity.

### 💡 Think of GitHub as:
> A social network + backup drive for your Git projects.

### 🔒 GitHub Repository Types:
- **Public**: Visible to everyone (good for open-source).
- **Private**: Only visible to you and your team.

## 🧰 Example Workflow

1. Create a repository on GitHub.
2. Clone it using GitHub Desktop or `git clone`.
3. Add your project files.
4. Stage changes: `git add .`
5. Commit changes: `git commit -m "Your message"`
6. Push to GitHub: `git push`
7. Others can pull updates or collaborate using pull requests.
