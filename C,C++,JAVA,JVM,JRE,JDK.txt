1.The main purpose of any programming language is to slove a problem

2.computer contains keyboard,mouse, monitor,cpu.... these are the pereferable devices which help us to interacting with computer
3.computer is nothing but processer(which have all the system data like word, notepad,graphics...)


4.Operating system is a way to interact with proceser.There are diffrenent Operating systems they are DOS COMMANDS,Command prompt
for day to day use use DOS commands are not comfortable so they comeup with windows,MAC,Linux. each one have their own capability.
5.On Windows if we want anything open on the browser search it and download
for example:  i have custom requriement like the student is pass or fail on the exam for doing this we need some computing capability.
In order do thatwe have 2 ways 
I)directly interactwith the processor and II) have some other languages that can interact with processor indirectly 
eg:watching a unkown launguage moviw with known subtitles.


6.computer understands only the binary language(0's and 1's) as humans we cant talk to the computer with 1's and 0's so that is the reason
we have many programming languages like c,c++,java,.net,python,datascience....
earlier we use the languages like cobal,pascal most of them are depreciated because of less usage.
Now presently we are using the languages like java,python,c++,.net.....
The commomn agenda of all these programmimg languages is to get the user task completed by interacting with processor.
each of these languages have differentset of features and their own capabilites.


			WHY JAVA
			------------

7.compare to c,c++ JAVA have more features, on java we have OOPS concepts,java is a platform independent language,
java have garbage collcters.java dosen't have pointers
eg:the buyer is purchasing the for 7k rupees having 10k features and another phone with 15k features
we can pick the 15k features phone becuse it have more features


8.c,c++ have there own pro's and con's. There are certain areas java is very strong, there are certain areasc,c++ are strong.
on c language we don't have OOPS concepts
c++ have OOPS concepts but the c++ platform-dependent language.
for desigining any web application python is the strongest language.
9.platform is the combination of O.S and processer(platform=O.S+processor)
On c or c++ we have the source code file we have to convert that source code into a code which processer can understand
				
			source code,compiler,processer,bytecode,interpreter,platform
		-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
10.on programming languages we have certain Keywords.These Keywords are simple english Keywords we can write in
other languages also like japanse,chinese..we are from India so we can use the English language

11.source-code is the human readable form of a program written by humans.

12.compiler will do thhe task the source-code translates to the binary(0's,1's).compilier is platform independent
on c,c++ the compilers if the source-code is compiling the .obj file gets generated.
If we that on my computer the compiler is looking for the processer first it has to understand the exact processer 
and which O.S currently using there is a chance that the O.S and  differnt processer will get
eg:linux+interpl--->difficult to run because of the combination



13.The MAC have different binary and intelchips windows have have different OS and processer,linux have different
for suppose the OS is Mac and the processer is windows the compliation get very difficulty.

14.Java will sloving compile once and run anywhere that means we are tring to compile the source code and there will be an intermeditary file
which is eligible for running anywhere.

15.Byte-code is the intermeaditary code generated after compiling java source-code.
Byte-code is the primary output of the java compiler
Byte-code in java means platform-independent independent intermediate code


                         |-----------------------|
                         |   sourcecode          |.java file

          |JVM WINDOWS|           |JVM LINUX|                   |JVM MAC|
          -------------           ------------                  ----------
            |                      |                               |
        MACHINECODE              MACHINECODE                    MACHINECODE


16.The source-code(.java file)will compile by the compiler and get the byte-code(.class file).
The Byte-code is source of everything which the interpreter take and converts them into machinecode.
eg:java is like cooked food having all ingredents whereas c++ is have all ingredents but the food is not prepare.


17.An Interpreter code in java is a code program that executes bytecode instructions


18.platform is a combination of OS and processer[PLATFORM= O.S+PROCESSER]
-->Compiler is responsible for generating the byte-code.compiler is platform independent
-->JVM 	OR THE INTERPRETER TAKES THE RESPONSIBILITY THE BYTE-CODE CONVERTS TO THE PROCESSER UNDERSTANDABLITY LANGUAGE
JVM is platform dependent..



                    			JVM,javac,JDK,JRE
			-----------------------------------------------------------
19.JVM(java virtual machine)is taking the task of translating the byte-code to machinecodethe computer processer can understand and executes the program
java becomes independent because of the byte-code
JVM is an abstract machine that excutes java byte-code
JVM is a part of JRE.
JVM considered platform-dependent because each OS has a different JVM implementation


20.when you compile the java program the byte-code is generated.The compiler is generated a code independent of processer and OS.
java compiler(javac) is machine independent that meansit will generates the code which is independent of your processer.
Java compiler is not included in JRE


21.JDK(Java Devlopement Kit) is used for developing java applications it includes tools needed for developement it is a combination of JRE and developement tools

22.JRE(Java Runtime Environment)provides the necessary environment to run java applicxations it includes JVM,Java class librarires
JRE is a part of JDK

23.Libraries means a set of file which can do the specific task.`


					Imporatnt points
				--------------------------------------
1.Java is platform independent because byte-code runs on a platform specific JVM
2.C++ language allows direct use of pointers
3.Byte-code is the primary output of the java compiler
4.Byte-code in java means platform-independent intermediate code
5.JVM considered platform-dependent because each OS has a different JVM implementation
6.To locate java tools like javac and java from any directory
7.compiler converts all code to byte-code before execution
8.java follows compilation to byte-code followed by interpretation by JVM
9.Java compiler is not included in JRE
10.JRE is a part of JDK
