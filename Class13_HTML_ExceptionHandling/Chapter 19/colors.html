HSL
HSL stands for hue, saturation, and lightness. This is another way to set colour properties.

Breaking each keyword:

Hue(h)
Hue represents the type of color. It is measured in degrees, and its value lies from 0 to 360.
0 degree represents black, 120 degree is for green, and 360 degree is for blue.
Saturation (S):
Saturation controls the intensity or purity of the color. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
0% saturation is no color (grayscale), and 100% saturation is the most intense colour.
Lightness (L):
Lightness determines how light or dark the colour is. It is measured in percentage, and its value lies between 0% and 100%.
0% lightness represents pure black, 50% lightness represents normal colour, and 100% lightness is pure white.
