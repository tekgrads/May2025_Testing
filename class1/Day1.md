# Introduction to Programming Languages

Programming languages are used to complete user tasks.

- **Python** provides easier syntax and faster prototyping.
- **C/C++** is used for system-level and performance-critical applications.
- **Java** is used for full stack development, enterprise environments, and large applications.

# What is Java?

Java is a popular procedural and object-oriented programming language. It was created in **1995** and is owned by **Oracle**.

- Java is secure, fast, and powerful.
- Java works on different platforms (Windows, Mac, Linux, etc.).
- It has huge community support.
- Java is **platform independent**.

# Why Choose Java Over Other Programming Languages?

Java is a popular programming language because it offers **platform independence** through its bytecode and **JVM**, allowing programs to run on any device without modification.

### Benefits of Java:
- Platform independent
- Strong typing
- Good performance
- Enterprise support
- Rich ecosystem
- Scalability
- Security

Java is widely used in enterprise environments, scales well for large applications, and maintains **backward compatibility**, ensuring older code continues to work with newer versions.

# Java Installation

1. Open Chrome and search for **"download Java"**.
2. Download **JDK 24 version**.
3. To check installation:
   - Open Command Prompt and type:  
     ```
     java --version
     ```
4. Set the **System Environment Variables**:
   - Go to **Environment Variables â†’ Path**
   - Add the **`bin`** path under **System Variable**
   - Note: There are two types of environment variables:
     - User Variable
     - System Variable

# Java Concepts

## Bytecode
- **Bytecode** is the compiled form of your `.java` source code file.
- When you compile a Java program using `javac`, the Java compiler translates the code into bytecode stored in a `.class` file.
- This bytecode is **platform-independent**.

## Interpreter
- An **interpreter** is a program that reads and executes code **line by line**.
- It translates high-level code (like Python, JavaScript, etc.) into machine code **one line at a time**.

## JVM (Java Virtual Machine)
- The engine that **runs Java bytecode**.
- Responsible for converting bytecode to machine-understandable code.
- JVM is a part of the **JRE**.

## JRE (Java Runtime Environment)
- A package that includes the JVM, Java class libraries, and files.
- Provides the **runtime environment** to run Java applications.

## JDK (Java Development Kit)
- A complete development package for Java developers.
- Includes:
  - JRE
  - Java Compiler
  - Debugger
  - Other development tools
