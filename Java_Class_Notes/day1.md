# What is Java?

Java is a **high-level, object-oriented programming language**. It is known for being **platform independent**, meaning:

> **Write once, run anywhere**

---

## Why is Java Platform Independent?

**Platform = Operating System + Processor**

When you write a Java program, the **Java compiler (`javac`)** compiles the code into **bytecode**, not machine-specific code.

### Bytecode

- Intermediate code generated by the Java compiler (`javac`) after compiling a Java program.
- Only the **JVM (Java Virtual Machine)** can understand and execute it.
- The compiled `.class` file is called **bytecode**.

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- Converts **bytecode** to **machine-understandable language**.
- Each operating system has its own JVM implementation that can interpret and execute bytecode.

---

## Execution by JVM

1. The JVM runs the `.class` (bytecode) file.
2. Each operating system has its own version of the JVM.
3. The JVM interprets the same bytecode on any platform (Windows, Linux, macOS, Android, etc.).

### So:

- **You compile once** to bytecode.
- **You can run** that bytecode on **any device** with a compatible JVM.

## Which One is Platform Independent: `javac` or `java`?

| Component | Platform Dependent/Independent | Explanation |
|----------|-------------------------------|-------------|
| `javac` (Java Compiler) | Platform Dependent | Written in native code, so each OS needs a different binary (e.g., `javac.exe` for Windows). |
| `java` (JVM Command) | Platform Independent | Uses JVM to run bytecode. Each OS has its own JVM that can interpret the same `.class` files. |

## Java Components

### JVM (Java Virtual Machine)

- Converts bytecode into machine-level instructions.
- Part of both JRE and JDK.

### JRE (Java Runtime Environment)

- Provides necessary **libraries** and the **JVM** to run Java applications.
- Does **not** include development tools like `javac`.

### JDK (Java Development Kit)

- A full-featured kit for Java development.
- Includes: **JRE + JVM + Compiler + Tools**
- Used to **build and test** Java applications.

## Setting Up the Java Programming Environment

### Step 1: Download and Install the JDK

- Visit the [Oracle official website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
- Download the **JDK 24 x64 installer** and install it.

### Step 2: Set Up Environment Variables

- Set `JAVA_HOME` to the JDK installation directory.
- Add the JDK's `bin` directory to your system's `PATH` variable.

### Step 3: Verify Installation

Open Command Prompt and run:

```bash
java -version
javac -version
