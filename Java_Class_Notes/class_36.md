# Spring Framework Overview

---

## What is an Application Framework?

- An **application framework** is a reusable software platform that helps in building applications by providing structure and prebuilt functionalities.
- Examples: Spring, Django, Ruby on Rails
- Benefits:
  - Solves common development problems like dependency management, configuration, security, etc.
  - Promotes **loose coupling**, **modular development**, and **code reuse**.

---

## What is Spring Framework?

- **Spring** is a lightweight Java framework for building enterprise applications.
- It simplifies development using:
  - **Inversion of Control (IoC)**
  - **Dependency Injection (DI)**
  - **Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP)**

## Real-World Problems Spring Solves

| Problem                                  | Spring's Solution                         |
|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| Tight coupling between components        | IoC + DI                                  |
| Repetitive configuration code            | Annotations & Java-based Config           |
| Manual transaction handling              | Declarative Transaction Management        |
| Complex integrations (REST, JMS, DB)     | Built-in Integration Support              |

## Core Spring Concepts with Examples

---

### 1. Inversion of Control (IoC)

> IoC means the control of creating and managing objects is transferred from the application to the Spring Container.

**Without IoC:**

```java
public class Car {
    private Engine engine = new Engine();
}
````

**With IoC (Constructor Injection):**

```java
@Component
public class Car {
    private Engine engine;

    @Autowired
    public Car(Engine engine) {
        this.engine = engine;
    }
}
```

---

### 2. Dependency Injection (DI)

> DI is a design pattern where the object dependencies are passed externally.

**Types:**

* Constructor Injection
* Setter Injection
* Field Injection

---

### Constructor Injection

```java
@Component
public class Laptop {
    private Processor processor;

    @Autowired
    public Laptop(Processor processor) {
        this.processor = processor;
    }
}
```

---

### Setter Injection

```java
@Component
public class Mobile {
    private Battery battery;

    @Autowired
    public void setBattery(Battery battery) {
        this.battery = battery;
    }
}
```

---

### Field Injection 

```java
@Component
public class Speaker {
    @Autowired
    private Amplifier amplifier;
}
```

---

## Spring Container

* The **Spring container** is responsible for instantiating, configuring, and managing beans.
* It reads **configuration metadata**:

  * XML
  * Java Annotations
  * Java Config Classes

---

## Bean Configuration with @Component and @Configuration

```java
@Component
public class HelloService {
    public String sayHello() {
        return "Hello Spring!";
    }
}
```

```java
@Configuration
@ComponentScan("com.example")
public class AppConfig {
}
```

```java
public static void main(String[] args) {
    ApplicationContext context = new AnnotationConfigApplicationContext(AppConfig.class);
    HelloService service = context.getBean(HelloService.class);
    System.out.println(service.sayHello());
}
```

---

## Using @Bean for Manual Configuration

```java
@Configuration
public class AppConfig {

    @Bean
    public Address address() {
        return new Address("Hyderabad", "500081");
    }

    @Bean
    public Employee employee() {
        return new Employee("Sathvika", address());
    }
}
```

## Spring Scopes

| Scope     | Description                            |
| --------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Singleton | One instance per container (default)   |
| Prototype | New instance every time it's requested |
| Request   | One per HTTP request (Web only)        |
| Session   | One per HTTP session (Web only)        |

---

## Circular Dependency Example

**Problem:**

```java
@Component
public class A {
    @Autowired
    B b;
}

@Component
public class B {
    @Autowired
    A a;
}
```

**Spring throws**: `BeanCurrentlyInCreationException` if circular dependency through constructor.

**Solution**: Use setter injection or refactor design.

## Maven Dependency for Spring Core

Add to `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-context</artifactId>
  <version>6.2.9</version>
</dependency>
```

## Spring Module Overview

| Module          | Purpose                                      |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Spring Core     | IoC & Dependency Injection                   |
| Spring Context  | ApplicationContext, Bean lifecycle           |
| Spring AOP      | Aspect-Oriented Programming                  |
| Spring JDBC     | Simplified JDBC operations                   |
| Spring MVC      | Build web applications                       |
| Spring Boot     | Auto-configuration & embedded server support |
| Spring Security | Secure your applications                     |
| Spring Data     | Access to relational and NoSQL databases     |

## ApplicationContext vs BeanFactory

| Feature            | ApplicationContext | BeanFactory     |
| ------------------ | ------------------ | --------------- |
| Type               | Advanced container | Basic container |
| Lazy Init          | No (eager)         | Yes (lazy)      |
| Event Propagation  | Yes                | No              |
| Bean PostProcessor | Yes                | No              |

---


* Spring provides a **robust foundation** for modern enterprise applications.
* Encourages **loose coupling**, **testability**, and **clean architecture**.
* Spring Boot builds on top of Spring to simplify everything further.
